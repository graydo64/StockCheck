StockTake
=========

Stock-taking application for the UK wet trade.

Coming from an application development background I'm frustrated at using Excel as a Stock Taking application for my local pub.  I want to create an application that can be used by multiple (though not many) users and that could facilitate e.g. counts being performed on a smart phone or tablet.  Users should be able to view stock take information online and ideally export it to an application of their choice, e.g. Excel or pdf.

I believe in evolutionary architecture so how the application is put together is likely to be pretty fluid.  I'm starting by using f# throughout - because I want to - and with WebApi and AngularJs for presentation.
